# md
A simple shell script to create a directory and cd into it. Copy the md.sh file to /usr/local/bin with the command cp and give executable permission using 'sudo chmod +x md.sh'. Now you can run the command from anywhere you want, but everytime you have to give source before running as 'source md.sh <directory name>'. After running the command, you will automatically cd into the newly created directory.
